<h2> ✨ About me </h2>

My name is Fernando, I'm 19 years old and I live in São Vicente, SP. I started to program about 1 year ago after finishing high school. 
My first contact with programming was in a 'python' course at 'udemy', for beginners. A few months later, I enrolled at university, studying Systems Analysis and Development, where I am in the 3rd cycle. At the same time I started to learn Web Development with some online events, and since then I'm studying the basics of Web Development, and I aim to learn more and more.
